## Reproducing Results

The results are in the `results/` directory. If you wish to reproduce them, please see the script `exp.py` in the `experiments` directory. The script takes two arguments:

```
--exp-name / -e, type=str (one of Turkish-CHILDES|Turkish-Morpho|Finnish|Latin)
--model / -m type=str, (one of D2L|GR|trigram|TSLIA|GG|LSTM)
```

`exp-name` specifies which dataset to produce the results for. `model` specifies which model to run. The results are saved in the directory `results/{exp_name}/{model}`.

## Running on Your Own Data

D2L is implemented in the Python package [algophon](https://github.com/cbelth/algophon). I recommend that implementation for running the model on your own dataâ€”just `pip install algophon`!
